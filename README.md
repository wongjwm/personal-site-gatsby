## Personal Portfolio

This is the repo for my personal website. You can check out the site at https://judy-wm-wong.com/! Built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Developing 
To start a start development environment use `gatsby develop`.

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at `localhost:8000`.

### Production Build
To create a production build, use `gatsby build`

Gatsby will perform an optimized production build for your site, generating static HTML and per-route JavaScript code bundles.

### Serving locally
To start a local server: `gatsby serve`.

Gatsby starts a local HTML server for testing your built site. Remember to build your site using `gatsby build` before using this command.
