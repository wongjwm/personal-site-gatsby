<p>As an active member of the Asian-American community at Northeastern University, I always looked for ways to get involved. This desire manifested into the design work I've done over my past years at school. </p>

<p>During my 2nd year of college, I was previously Media & Design Specialist of the Chinese Student Association, which involved everything from creating marketing materials for events that hundreds of people attended, to designing apparel for the club to sell. </p>

<p>The Asian-American Center on campus also holds an annual Asian-American Heritage Month in which many speakers are invited to discuss a variety of topics. I was approached to design the branding and collateral for the entire event, and was given much freedom on design choices.</p>

<p>In addition to these two substantial positions, I've also had the opportunity to design one-off logos for programs within the Asian-American community. </p>
