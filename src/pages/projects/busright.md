<p>During the Fall 2018 semester, I was a part of Scout, Northeastern University's student-led design studio, which takes on new clients every semester and works with them to deliever what they need. The client my team worked with was BusRight.</p>

<p>BusRight is a startup that aims to alleviate the stresses of school buses via technology. As Scout's client, we provided them with branding, a marketing website, and the front-end for a management application which our team figured would be a beneficial solution.</p>

My role on the team was both designer and developer. As someone who takes in interest in both aspects of creation, as well as the actual implementation, I took on different roles during my time on the team. 

In terms of design, I took on the role of a UI/UX designer via creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes. 

As for development, I spearheaded the development of the marketing website and worked alongside the marketing website designer on our team. The site was built using  <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site generator framework that I was not familiar with initially, but quickly got accustomed to.
