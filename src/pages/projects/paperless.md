<p>Paperless is an application that allows users to easily track their physical receipts and access data that is relevant to their spending habits. Through Optical Capture Recognition, a technology which is able to parse an image of a physical receipt into raw data, Paperless is able to store this data as individual entries, as well as visualize meaningful data. </p>

<p> The inspiration for Paperless came to me as I was thinking of problems that did not yet have a solution. Then, one day, when I wished to return a piece of clothing to a store, I realized I couldn't because I had no idea where I had put the receipt. Paperless offers a solution to this, as a receipt tracking platform, in addition to the meaningful data it offers to users about their spending. Created for Interaction Design 1 final project. </p>

<p>Other topics of further exploration within this project could include exactly what data is most meaningful to users, as well as how to most effectively visually display this data. </p>
