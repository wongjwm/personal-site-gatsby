<p>My first personal website was built using simply HTML/CSS. While it did the job at the time, it didn't allow for flexibility and easy expansion. For a second version of my personal online portfolio, I developed this website using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, a powerful static website generator. Gatsby makes use of <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, a Javascript framework I was already familiar with, in addition to <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, a natural querying language, which I managed to pick up some of along the way! The site is deployed using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p>

<p>As for the design of the website itself, I wanted to keep it simple in order for the work to show itself off.</p>
